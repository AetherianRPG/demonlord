## **Features**

### **General:**

Remember, that you as a player only can effect your own Actor and not take damage or heal other Actors. It's the job of the GM to micromanage damage/healing etc.

As a GM when you need to apply damage/healing you just select a single or more actors and then use the apply button in the chat.

### **Combat Tracker:**

Uses the standard Combat Tracker but with a few changes. It still uses the standard way of having a initiative value that determines the order of actors. You can still change the number manually if your players need a different order.

- It shows FAST/SLOW turns for each Actor.
- When rolling/rerolling initiative you are prompted to choose between Fast or Slow turn.
- It's also possible to change turn order directly in the Combat Tracker by clicking on FAST/SLOW on your actor.
- On your character sheet at the top of the window their is a "Actor Mods" menu button. Their you can set the default initiative turn order for you character, npcs and creatures. When you create an Actor the default is set to Slow.
- Use characteristics.health to track damage on your token. It uses characteristics.health.value for damage score and characteristics.health.max as health score.
- System Settings: I added som settings regarding showing messages in the chat log when changing between fast and slow turn and randomizing the initiative a lille.
