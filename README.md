# Shadow of the Demonlord System

This is Shadow of the Demonlord for FoundryVTT.

Shadow of the Demonlord has no open license, but permission was granted to make the system.

It a basic and playable character and creature sheet but not with much automation. 

**Combat Tracker:**
Uses the standard Combat Tracker but with a few changes. It still uses the standard way of having a initiative value that determines the order of actors. You can still change the number manually if your players need a different order.

1. It shows FAST/SLOW turns on each Actor.
2. When rolling/rerolling initiative you are prompted to choose between Fast or Slow turn.
3. On your character sheet at the top of the window their is a "Actor Mods" menu button. Their you can set the default initiative turn order for you character, npcs and creatures. When you create an Actor the default is set to Slow.
4. System Settings: I added som settings regarding showing messages in the chat log when changing between fast and slow turn and randomizing the initiative a lille.

**Compendiums:**
The weapons, armors and ammunition from the core rulebook is available for draging and droping onto your character sheet.
