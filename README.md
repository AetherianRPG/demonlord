# System: Shadow of the Demonlord

This is Shadow of the Demonlord for FoundryVTT.

Shadow of the Demonlord has no open license, but permission was granted to make the system.

It a basic and playable character and creature sheet but not with much automation. 

### **Combat Tracker:**
Uses the standard Combat Tracker but with a few changes. It still uses the standard way of having a initiative value that determines the order of actors. You can still change the number manually if your players need a different order.

* It shows FAST/SLOW turns on each Actor.
* When rolling/rerolling initiative you are prompted to choose between Fast or Slow turn.
* On your character sheet at the top of the window their is a "Actor Mods" menu button. Their you can set the default initiative turn order for you character, npcs and creatures. When you create an Actor the default is set to Slow.
* System Settings: I added som settings regarding showing messages in the chat log when changing between fast and slow turn and randomizing the initiative a lille.

### **Compendiums:**
The weapons, armors and ammunition from the core rulebook is available for draging and droping onto your character sheet.
